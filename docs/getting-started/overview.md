> **Preview**: The web studio is provided as a preview feature, allowing you to familiarize with the new concepts and philosophy. This feature is still in early stages of development, it's not recommended to use it in a production environment. 

4D WebStudio is a powerful platform for web design and development that lets you build web applications from your browser. 

More specifically, it is an integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you tap into various data sources (for example, the database of a 4D project), and link them to interface elements in order to build complete applications.

At this stage, only the Web Form Designer, the code editor and the contextual configuration panel are available.

> The web studio is not compatible with binary databases.

## Known limitations

Since the web studio is still in early stages of development, some features are not yet available. At this stage:

* There is no debugger for the web studio

* Navigation features are still in development. You can already embed a WebForm inside another.
