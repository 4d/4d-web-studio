> **Preview**: The web studio is provided as a preview feature, allowing you to familiarize with the new concepts and philosophy. This feature is still in early stages of development, it's not recommended to use it in a production environment. 

4D WebStudio is a powerful low-code platform for web design and development that lets you build web applications from yor browser. 

More specifically, it's an integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you tap into various data sources (for example, the database of a 4D project), and link them to interface elements in order to build complete applications.

At this stage, only the Web Form Designer, the code editor and the contextual configuration panel are available.
