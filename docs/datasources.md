## What is a datasource?

Data sources contain data. You can bind them to your Webform components to determine where the data is displayed in your application.

The **Data Sources** section groups the available datasources:

In this section, you'll find the following:

*  The **Catalog** holds:
    * data from your database: You can designate entities or entity selections from your [datastore](https://developer.4d.com/docs/en/ORDA/dsmapping.html), and they will be handled by the server as **Remote** datasources.
    * Class functions: The Catalog displays the functions defined in each class. 

*  **Remote** datasources: Entities and entity selections, handled on the server, that can be assigned to components. 
They offer functions defined on the [ORDA classes](https://developer.4d.com/docs/en/ORDA/ordaClasses.html#class-description) that they instantiate (Entity class, Entity Selection class).

*  **Local** datasources: Scalar types handled with the browser's memory. Can be assigned to variables. No request is sent to the server to access local datasources.

### Exposed and non-exposed assets

4D Web Studio runs through the [4D WebAdmin web server](https://developer.4d.com/docs/en/Admin/webAdmin.html). When you use 4D Web Studio as a developer, even when you preview a webform in the studio, youâ€™re using the 4D WebAdmin web server. This allows you to see dataclasses, functions and attributes that are not exposed as REST resources for example (they are greyed out).

However, [webform rendering](webforms/rendering.md) happens outside 4D Web Studio, and is served by the [standard 4D web server](https://developer.4d.com/docs/en/WebServer/webServer.html). In this situation, your web application cannot access assets that are not exposed as REST resources.

See [Exposed vs non-exposed functions](https://developer.4d.com/docs/en/ORDA/ordaClasses.html#exposed-vs-non-exposed-functions) and [Exposing tables](https://developer.4d.com/docs/en/REST/configuration.html#exposing-tables) for more information on how to expose assets.

## Creating a datasource 

##### From the Catalog

1. In the Data Sources section, choose **Catalog** > **Data Classes**
2. Click the "+" icon next to a dataclass
3. Select Entity or Entity Selection and click **Confirm**. The newly created Entity or Entity selection now appears as a Remote datasource

#### From a Remote datasource

Click the "+" icon:
* next to an entity selection to create an entity
* next to an entity's relation to create an entity selection or an entity 

#### From a Text component

Select text inside a **Text** component and click the **Toggle Datasource** icon to create a local datasource.


## Binding a datasource to a component

There are several ways to bind a datasource to a component:

* Drag it from the Data Source section and drop it on a component
* Select a component and enter the name of the datasource in the Properties panel > Data Access > DataSource 

## Attaching events to datasources 

You can attach events to datasources to trigger certain actions when a datasource is updated. See [Attaching an event to a datasource](events.md#example-2-attaching-an-event-to-a-datasource) for more information.
