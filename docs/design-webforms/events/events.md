title: Events and interactions

Events are usually used as a means of triggering certain behaviors. They are used in conjunction with different actions to create interaction in an application.

For example, if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you can choose how to react by calling a function or opening another webpage. Events can also be triggered [when a datasource is updated](datasource-events.md). 

With 4D Web Studio, events are used to execute code on the 4D web server. No additional Javascript is needed.

## Configuring an event

You can bind your webform events to different actions such as executing a function or navigating to another webform.

### Bind a class function to an event

1. Select a component or a datasource. The configuration panel displays the events compatible with the element selected

2. Click a "+" button in the list to attach the corresponding event to the component or datasource. 

3. Select **execute a Member Function**

4. Add parameters (datasources or values) and point at a local or remote datasource to update.

A class function can be mapped to several events, and you can assign several events to the same class function.

### Bind a navigation action to an event

To create navigation in your application, you can attach a navigation action to an event. That way, when the event triggers, it opens a webform in the current browser tab or in a new one.

1. Select a component or a datasource and attach an event to it
2. Select the webform to open when the event triggers
3. Define if the webform opens in the current browser tab or a new one:

:::note

Webforms do not currently share their contexts. This means that datasources are currently not shared between webforms. For example, you cannot use webform1's datasources in webform2.

## Event types

Events can be set to trigger when end-users perform certain actions, or when datasources are updated.
### User events

You can set events to trigger when end-users perform certain actions, such as clicking a button.

#### Example: Creating a search feature using the `onChange` event

The objective is to update a list of students displayed in a **Matrix** component according to what the end-user types in an input area.

In the image below: 
* The **Input** element is bound to the local datasource `search` (of type Text)
* The **Matrix** component displays a list of students based on the `students` datasource, which is an entity selection

![search](img/search-component.png)

To display results corresponding to the text typed in the **Input** component, we need a `search` function that performs a query:

```4d
exposed Function search($search : Text)->$result : cs.StudentsSelection
	
$search:="@"+$search+"@"
	
$result:=This.query("firstname = :1 or lastname = :1"; $search)   
```

An **onChange** event calls the `search` function and passes the text typed in the **Input** element as a parameter. This updates the `students` datasource:

![search](img/search-event.png)

Now everytime the text changes inside the **Input** element, a query is sent and the list of students displayed in the **Matrix** component is updated.

###  Datasource events

Aside from events triggered by end-user actions, events can trigger automatically when datasources are updated.

For a list of datasource events, see [List of available events](#list-of-available-events).

### Example 

In the image below: 

* The **Datatable** component displays a list of employees, based on an entity selection (the `employees` datasource is attached).
* The button slices the `employees` entity selection datasource to keep only the first three entities.
* An `onChange` event is attached to the `employees` datasource.
* The **Text** component contains a local datasource of type Text, called *result*.

![event-datasource](img/event-datasource.png)

When the end-user clicks the button, the `employees` datasource is updated, triggering the `onChange` event. This calls `displayValue` to update *result*:

![event-datasource-event](img/event-datasource-event.png)

The `displayValue` function returns text according to the number of entities: 

```4d 
exposed function displayValue() -> $result : Text
$result:="The table now displays " + String(This.length) + " entries"
```

Here's what you obtain after the button is clicked:

### On Change

An On Change event attached a datasource triggers in the following cases:

|Trigger|Description|
|---|---|
|Datasource|<ul><li>The reference pointed by the datasource changes in the web browser (not on the server)</li><li>The entity is [touched](https://developer.4d.com/docs/en/API/EntityClass.html#touched)</li></ul>|
|Entity attribute|The contents of the entity attribute change.|
|Local datasource|The contents of the local datasource change.|
|Entity selection datasource| <li>The reference pointed by the datasource changes in the web browser (not on the server)</li>
<li>An entity is added to the entity selection</li>|

## Chaining actions

You can attach several events to a component or datasource. 

When the event triggers, 

Events are executed in their defined order.
